# Portfolio

<h2>I have a lot of different projects in this resposity:</h2>
<h3>Website</h3>
<p>I have a website, aidanmcgloin.com, where I post some of my stories, photos and graphics. I wrote the code for the website from scratch. I also posted my senior project on the website: <a href="https://aidanmcgloin.com/blog/senior_project">Economic barriers to media entrepreneurship and media plurality".</a></p>
<h3>Book review website</h3>
<p>I also host code to both automate a book review website and to host my own version of the site.</p>
<h3>Extensions</h3>
<p>I created extensions that change your new tab page to a collage of news stories recently published by either <a href="https://aidanmcgloin.com/extension/newtabs.html">CalMatters</a>, Mustang News or the Golden Gate Xpress. The extensions are now defunct on the Chrome store, but can be set to your starting page if you link them.</p>
