    <h1 id="header">Book thoughts</h1><h2 id='bio_header'>What I read</h2><p id='bio_text'>Thank you for checking out my website! I like to think that I have a varied interest in books. I recently began a challenge to read through all the book recommendations I have received for as far back as I can remember. So far that has included Steinbeck's <i>Cannery Row</i>, Christie's <i>And Then There Were None </i>and Heinlein's <i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i>. Besides those books, I've been trying to read alongside some of my friends, in a book club of two. After those, I've been getting more involved in gothic horror, specifically Shirley Jackson. I read half of Upton Sinclair's Lanny Budd series, a historically accurate and informative historic fiction series about European politics starting right before World War One and ending in the Cold War. My background is in journalism, so I have a fascination with books about the 1st Amendment, civil rights, and the free press.

<h1>Reviews</h1><h2 id='Napoleon A Life (Part 1)'><i>Napoleon A Life (Part 1)</i> by Andrew Roberts</h2><p>I'm reading an amazing 810 page biography of Napoleon, a birthday present from my girlfriend. So far, I love it. It's well-written and inspirational. The bonly issue I have had with it is that Roberts is definitely writing in a pro-Napoleonic style: by that, I mean he chooses words and writes about events in clear support of toward Napoleon.  In one section, he talks about the printing press Napoleon brought to Egypt to spread pamphlets among the Egyptions. In reality, his translators did a poor job and Egyptions could not understand the writings. Roberts doesn't mentoin that: I would assume everything went well with the press just by reading the book.<br><br>I'm on page 170 now, so it's good to put down some thoughts. For one thing, it's suprising how little Napoleon cared about France or the Revolution before he took command of the Army of Italy. He was Corsican—from an island controlled by the Italian kingdom of Genoa. His family allied themselves with aa Corsican rebellion against Genoa, then against the French when the Genoans sold the island to the French, then they allied themselves with the French again. Napoleon was more concerned with the Corsican rebellion than the French Revolution—and wrote romantic anti-French literature. At the time of the Revoluion he was also trying to reconcile his family's debts, not advancing any kind of cause..<br><br>Napoleon cared so little about France and his job as a French military officer that he took years off from work by submitting falsified sick notes.<br><br>Still, he read a lot. He admired Alexander the Great and read Roman history. Roberts cites him as being a massive fan of Goethe's <i>Sorrows of Young Werther</i>, and brought the book with him on his campaigns. Other books and authors: Caesar, Cicero, Voltaire, Diderot, Abbe Raynal, Erasmus, Eutropius, Livy, Phaedrus, Sallust, Virgil, Polybius, Plutarch's <i>Parallel Lives</i>, Arrian's <i>Anabasis of Alexandar</i>, Rousseau's <i>La Nouvelle Heloise</i>, Ossian.<br><br>Napoleon was one of those men who claimed to be able to open one box in his mind when he was done with it, and open the next for whatever task he was on next. Roberts writes that he had amazing recall, and was able to reform everything from the legal system to taxes while conquering Italy.<br><br>No doubt he simply took the lessons learned from Rousseau and Voltaire and Livy and applied them. <br><br>At my current point in the book, the Italian campaign has concluded, Napoleon has gained tremoundous popularity, and he is marching to Cairo on the Egyptian campaign. The Italian campaign was apparently the time he first started considering governance, because of the tasks he put upon himself to reform the Italian nations away from an aristocratic and feudalistic society. It makes me think about the catalysts people need to bimprove. How often does s a person be so incredibly activated as Napoleon was on the campaign? Does iit require a revolution and a sudden placement at the top of the fighting forces of one of the most powerful nations on the planet? What mundane options activate people? How many people never rexperience a fraction of that?<br><br><br><br></p>
<h2 id='We Have Always Lived in the Castle'><i>We Have Always Lived in the Castle</i> by Shirley Jackson</h2><p>It's been a week since I finished this book, and I still don't know what to think of it. It's about two sisters that live together in their family's large Victorian house after their entire family was poisoned at dinner (with the exception of an uncle, who lives with them.) <br><br> It's also about small town persecution—Jackson felt she was persecuted by the town in which she lived, and brought her feelings into the book. But, throughout this book, I have wondered if the persecution against the sisters is justified. They certainly are weird, and as far as the town knows, one of them definitely murdered their family and got away with it. Hell, I'd persecute someone who I think put anthrax in the family's sugar bowl. The narrator is one of the sisters, and describes her needs the way a child does. She plans to trap herself in this house (that's not a spoiler, the name of the book is a nod to her commitment to stay there among her inheritance.) Her description of the house is similar to the house Jackson wrote about in The Haunting of Hill House: they're both cloying, insular traps where nothing happens. In both books, people live in them anyway instead of living their lives. Both books leave a lot open to interpretation. I enjoyed. 8/10.</p>
<h2 id='Cannery Row'><i>Cannery Row</i> by John Steinbeck</h2><p><i>Cannery Row</i> has been on my list since college: it was recommended to me by a friend, although I don't know which one. It's Steinbeck's eight book that I've read, and each new novel adds another layer to the next. This book is not about Monterey's Cannery Row at all. The cannery is mentioned as the place some people work, but we don't realy get to hear about them at all, besides a couple of characters that pick up jobs there in a very brief aside. It's about bums living in Monterey that decide to do something nice for a friend of theirs. It's about how they mess up theirat nice thing, and it's about how they mess up their lives. <i>Cannery Row</i> builds these guys up, and their landlord, and their friend, in such a way that you can almost touch them. And you are guaranteed to find bits of them in you, and in your friends as well. Overall, it's a beautiful book, and a short read. I recommend. 9/10. </p>
<h2 id="Les Miserables"><i>Les Miserables</i> by Victor Hugo</h2><p>People don’t often agree to be better versions of themselves.
    <p>
        That may sound obvious. But Les Miserables’ examination of that tendency—compared to the majority of literature's denial of it—is what makes the novel worthy of being in the Western canon. </p>
                <p>Let’s look at the biggest redemption story in Les Miserables.</p>
                <p>Jean Valjean is angry after being released from 19 years of penal slave labor for the crime of robbing bread from a baker’s house. He is turned away from hotels and can’t hold down a job because he is on parole. Bishop Myriel offers Valjean dinner and a bed. In response, Valjean steals Myriel’s silverware. Valjean is angry and confused, and quickly caught.</p>
        <p>Myriel has the chance to send Valjean back to the galleys. Instead, he lies to the police to save Valjean’s skin. He also gives him two additional silver candlesticks that were passed down from a family member.</p>
                <p>“I have bought your soul for God,” the bishop says. </p>
                <p>That’s not the end of it. Valjean is not instantly a good man. He become more confused than ever. He leaves town dazed and struggling with the meaning of Myriel’s gift. He robs a boy of 40-sous. He realizes he made a mistake. He tries to find the boy. He fails. Hugo mounts a long and exhaustive but perfectly paced description of Valjean’s struggle:</p>
        <p>“In the presence of these lights, he proceeded like a man who is intoxicated. As he walked thus with haggard eyes, did he have a distinct perception of what might result to him from his adventure at D——? Did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune the spirit at certain moments of life? Did a voice whisper in his ear that he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny; that there no longer remained a middle course for him; that if he were not henceforth the best of men, he would be the worst; that it behooved him now, so to speak, to mount higher than the Bishop, or fall lower than the convict; that if he wished to become good he must become an angel; that if he wished to remain evil, he must become a monster?”</p><p>
        That’s not the end of it, either. Valjean’s ethics are constantly questioned. We see his duties and failures as mayor, as factory owner, as surrogate father, as father-in-law, as savior. His transformation is long and thought-out, and not at all easy. Although he works on an individual level, he is not spoken at all as heroically as Enjolras, the hero of the barricades, is. At the end of the novel, you see him still struggling with guilt and doubt. 
        It is a true reflection of a person’s journey to become a better person. </p><p>
        His is not the only such transformation in the book. </p><p>
        Bishop Myriel himself is another example. He was born to an aristocratic family, and fled to Italy when the French Revolution broke out, presumably to protect himself from the guillotine. He returned as a priest, and was appointed a bishop by Napoleon. As bishop, he spurned the aristocratic tendencies of other bishops. He turns his palace into the hospital and the hospital into his home. He gives away all of his wealth to the poor. All of this is on an individual level.</p><p>
        Myriel’s second chance at self-transformation came later, when he met a dying revolutionary who had served as a representative in the First French Republic. The man lived as a hermit, exiled by the royalists in town. He refused Myriel’s offer of last rites. He dies without society, and without God. He carries out a death-bed defense as to the Revolution and his actions within it.</p><p>
        “I was sixty years of age when my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with its affairs. I obeyed. Abuses existed, I combated them; tyrannies existed, I destroyed them; rights and principles existed, I proclaimed and confessed them. Our territory was invaded, I defended it; France was menaced, I offered my breast. I was not rich; I am poor,” the revolutionary said.</p><p>
        Was Myriel changed by this man? No. He stayed working at a local, individual level, intentionally ignorant of any society-wide issues. 
        “Monseigneur Bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior of mysterious questions without scrutinizing them, and without troubling his own mind with them, and who cherished in his own soul a grave respect for darkness,” Hugo wrote.</p><p>
        That’s not to say Myriel was not a good man. He was. Hugo calls him a just man. He caused Valjean’s turn from blind rage. There is no doubt he improved the lives of his people. He did not, however, attend any higher purpose than working at an individual level.</p><p>
        This is ironic. Myriel may have been the most powerful character in the book. He was a bishop. He had served at a gathering of bishops at Napoleon’s request, but leaves before it is finished.</p><p>
        “The apostle may be daring, but the bishop must be timid. He would probably have felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certain problems which are, in a manner, reserved for terrible great minds,” Hugo wrote.</p><p>
        Javert is another prime example. He only believed in the law of man. He never questioned the law, or his duties. When Valjean saves him from the revolutionaries, he sees a natural law, of a life-debt, conflicting with his legal duties. He could either set Valjean above the law by releasing him, or violate the life-debt owed to Valjean by delivering him to a life of penal slave labor. </p><p>
        Unable to make a decision between these two options, he kills himself instead. He is what the existentialists would consider a serious man, a person who blindly accepts the morality prescribed to him. </p><p>
        Or take the case of Montparnasse, the head of a criminal organization known as the Patron-Minette. Montparnasse tries to rob Valjean, but Valjean seizes him instead and delivers a 1,300-word monologue in an attempt to reform him. He tries to warn him of the slave labor he will suffer if he continues a life of crime. At the end of it, Valjean tosses Montparnasse his purse. He gave away his money in the same way that Myriel gave away his candlesticks. Montparnasse’s response, as Valjean walks away?</p><p>
        “‘The blockhead!’ muttered Montparnasse.”</p><p>
        Or take Champmathieu, who was arrested for theft after taking an apple branch he found on the ground. The courts mistook him for Valjean. He was to be sentenced to a life sentence for the breaking of parole and the robbery of the boy’s 40 sous Valjean committed after meeting Myriel.</p><p>
        Valjean dramatically exposes himself to be the real culprit, throwing away his wealth and status in the interest of justice. Champmathieu walks free. 
        At this point, both Champmathieu and Valjean have been delivered from a life sentence. Champmathieu’s sentence would be for crimes he did not commit. Valjean’s was for theft. To save Champmathieu, Valjean had to give up his life. To save Valjean, Myriel had only to say the silverware was a gift. 
        Champmathieu’s salvation was undoubtedly more profound. Did the experience change him?</p><p>
        “Champmathieu, being at once released, went off in a state of stupefaction, thinking that all men were fools, and comprehending nothing of this vision,” Hugo wrote.</p><p>
        Some last examples. Marius becomes fascinated with Bonaparte, learns about his father’s military history in Napoleon’s campaigns, and spends time with the revolutionaries. Does this encourage him to fight for a French republic? No. He abandons them, preferring to walk the streets and pine after Cosette instead. It is lightly implied that his lack of participation caused the revolution to fail. (He did participate in the actual defense of the barricade, but that was more out of a death-wish than a moral decision.)</p><p>
        There are plenty of other characters who fail to live up to their moral potential. One revolutionary gets drunk during the revolution, and does not actually participate in the defense of the barricades. Another character receives a fortune and uses it to become a slave-trader. Fantine lives up to a moral standard, but is ruined by debtors, gossips and a philanderer.</p><p>
        Les Miserables is full of people not being the best versions of themselves. Is this common in books and shows? </p><p>
        No. </p><p>
        Most narratives of self-transformation are missing a choice, a reason for the choice, an actual transformation, or a transformation at all.</p><p>
        Before I continue, I am not saying these stories I am describing are terrible, I’m just saying that the construction of the character’s moral development is not as good as it could be. Every story I mention below I enjoyed. Maybe they didn’t focus on this aspect of character development because it was simply unnecessary to their story. Maybe they had a good reason to not focus on morality, or maybe they didn’t. </p><p>
                    <h3>Lack of choice</h3>
        <p>You’re the only one that can save us. You’re the chosen one. A prophecy says it has to be you. <br>
        Usually, for these narratives, the main character has some kind of imbued power that makes them better than everybody else. They were dragon-born, or were bitten by a radioactive spider. I’m looking at Harry Potter, Avatar the Last Airbender, Daenerys Targaryen, Stranger Things, The Santa Clause, and most superhero movies.</p><p>
        To develop themselves, the character has to accept they are better than everyone else and just use their natural power to take their rightful place as a leader and fighter. Maybe they get worried and have doubts, but they push through with little internal dialogue.<br>
        These stories give the false impression that the protagonist of a story has to be naturally better than everyone else. It’s anti-democratic, borderline elitist, and definitely aristocratic.</p><p>
        In reality, all men are born equal, and all men have chances to develop themselves and choose their lives. Every real-life hero is someone who chose to do a better job than other people. </p><p>
        These narratives also imply that society-wide issues are the responsibilities of single individuals, when they really are society-wide responsibilities. 
        Finally, these narratives lack any demonstration of actual self-improvement. The person is naturally better than everyone else, so they just have to find their center to win out in the end.</p><p>
                    <h3>No reason for the choice</h3>
        <p>This is when a person chooses to be a better person for the plot, without an actual explanation of the character’s reason for change. Movies are often guilty of this, and often due to time constraints. In the musical adaptation of Les Miserables, Valjean gets his two candlesticks and immediately becomes a paragon of justice. The Barbie movie used this trope, while simultaneously making fun of it, when Weird Barbie told Stereotypical Barbie she “has to want to know” the truth. </p><p>
        It feels like the writers are checking off some box on The Writer’s Journey. By avoiding any internal argument, they give the impression that self-improvement is a switch that people flip.</p>
                    <h3>No actual change</h3>
        <p>There’s a whole other category of stories in which the character slowly becomes more and more aware of personal or social issues, but does not address them by the time the story ends.</p><p>
        Good Will Hunting is an amazing movie, but it ends with good Will driving away. His final decision after agonizing over his future is to move to another city, with no further plan other than to hang out with his girlfriend. Is that character development? </p><p>
        St. Elmo’s Fire ends with a highly dysfunctional group of friends hanging out just as they did at the beginning. Their only change in habit? They ditched their old bar. Yes, the old bar is a metaphor. Yes, they all are just as childish and fucked-up as they were at the beginning.</p><p>
        The Hero’s Journey template ends with the hero returning to their daily life, the hobbit back to his shire. Why would any journey worth telling result in the hero being the same person they were before the experience, without any modifications to their lifestyle or worldview?</p><p>
        In any story of personal development, I want what Les Miserables provided. Everyday protagonists, without special mystical powers, who perceive and make choices to become better people. They wrestle with these choices, and make a decision consistent with their existing principles and personal history. Their decisions should actually alter the way they live, and not be a token improvement.</p><p>
        This goes beyond literary theory. Ask yourself what choices you have turned down. What requests to be better versions of yourself have you rejected or accepted? Have you actually considered them? Or did you avoid a decision by throwing yourself into distraction? Whatever decision you made, do you adhere to it with actions? Or do you simply think differently? In other words, do you live by your decisions, or do you just say you do?

                <h2 id="If This Isn't Nice, What Is?"><i>If This Isn't Nice, What Is?</i> by Kurt Vonnegut</h2>
                <p>This collection of graduation speeches provided a direct intimate look into Vonnegut's mind, which is often hidden by anecdotes and jokes. He speaks to the importance of large families, the importance of reading and the importance of secular humanism. The speeches are bite-sized. I've been to three graduation ceremonies: one for my brother's, one for a friend, and one for my girlfriend (my own was cancelled by the pandemic). Each of the speakers were boring, trite, and unmemorable. Vonnegut's speeches not only reinvigorated an appreciation for speeches in general, but replaced all my missed opportunities for graduation guidance. I recommend for anyone who's read Slaughterhouse 5 and who are begging to hear more. 9/10.</p>

                <h2 id="It Can't Happen Here"><i>It Can't Happen Here</i> by Sinclair Lewis</h2>
                <p>This book is anti-fascist propaganda from a time when fascism was extremely popular: 1935. This was before WWII, and while multiple Americans were actively speaking in favor of fascist policies. It details a fictional account of a fascist victory in the United States that results in the destruction of our democracy, featuring multiple real-life agitators. It raises questions of complicity, democracy, and civic duty. The protagonist is a newspaper editor in a small Vermont town. He struggles with what he should do in the face of the approaching autocracy. He's not as heoric as he thought. 10/10.</p>

                <h2 id="Dodsworth"><i>Dodsworth</i> by Sinclair Lewis</h2>
                <p>Sam Dodsworth is an industrius businessman who specialized in mid-market cars and who has come across retirement suddenly, with an unfulfilled 30-year promise to take his wife to Europe. Their travels across the continent are full of personal, private, and romantic mistakes. The heart of the novel is an existential question of individuality. Who is a person without a family, a community, a job and a purpose? Fran Dodsworth is cast two-dimensionally, she doesn't achieve much depth, and her character seems in part to be made as a vindiction against Sinclair Lewis' actual divorced wife. That's my only complaint. It's fun for travelers. 9/10.</p>
