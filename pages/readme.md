<h1>If you want your own website:</h1>
<p>Hi! I made a Python script to help people make their own book review websites.<p>
<p>This is easy to set up. If you want, this can provide you with a base knowledge of Python, HTML and CSS. You can edit the Python, edit the HTML, edit the CSS. If you don't want, you can just let the scripts run!</p>
<h3>An explanation</h3>
<p>I wrote Python scripts that, when you run them, turn your text into a properly structured book review website. I did this because, well, I thought it would make it easier for me to publish longer reviews than what I had on existing social media sites. I'm publishing it in case other people want to publish longer reviews as well. </p>
<p>You don't need to learn Python to use the scripts. It will prompt you with all of your inputs. All you do is open up your Terminal application, run the program, then copy and paste your text. To host the website, you will need a GitHub account (free). To make sure other people see the website, you will need to buy the url. That costs $13 a year. I like to use <a href="namecheap.com">Namecheap.</a></p>
<h3>To start</h3>
<p>Download the Python (.py) and CSS (.css) files in this folder. You can ignore the HTML files—that's the type of website the code generates. The Python files produce the HTML, and the CSS files format them. You can mess around with either if you want, but you won't need to.</p>
<h3>Execute</h3>
<p>Create the folder on your computer that you want to store this project in. Its name doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Open up your Terminal application (this will be for Macs, but if you have Windows, the command names are just slightly different, and you will do this in your Command instead of Terminal). Navigate to the folder you created. For example, if your folder is in your desktop, and the folder is called "website," you would navigate to it using the "cd" command: "cd desktop/website".</p>
<p>Once you're there, you're going to want to download Python, if you haven't already. Run "pip3 install python3".</p>
<p>Now you're ready to create!</p>
<h3>Make the site</h3>
<p>Run the first script using "python3 start.py". This script will ask you some questions, and you just have to answer them. To add a bio, run "python3 bio.py." To add a review, run "python3 addreview.py". I recommend having your reviews written ahead of time, but you can also type them directly into the </p>
<p>If you want to remove a review, run "python3 removereview.py". All versions of this page are archived whenever you run the script. You can find the archives in the archive folder. If you want to change your bio, just run the bio.py script again.</p>
<p>You can toy around with the CSS file (which determines the site's style/font/design) however you want.</p>
<h3>Host the site</h3>
<p>The last steps are to host the website. Upload your code on GitHub. Then register your url: I like to use Namecheap. The annual cost for Namecheap is typically $13, but it depends on the url you choose. After you register your url on namecheap, follow the directions on Namecheap's guide and GitHub's Pages to direct the url to your code. This is easy—but the documentation might change, so it's best to refer to them rather than me for this step.</p>
<h3>Post reviews!</h3>
<p>Your site is now live! You can add reviews whenever you want! You just need to upload your edited files to GitHub after you add or remove reviews.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions to improve my site's functions, please reach out!</p>
