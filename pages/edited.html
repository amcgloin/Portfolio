    <h1 id="header">Book thoughts<h2 id='bio_header'>What I read</h2><p id='bio_text'>Thank you for checking out my website! I like to think that I have a varied interest in books. I recently began a challenge to read through all the book recommendations I have received for as far back as I can remember. So far that has included Steinbeck's Cannery Row, Christie's And Then There Were None and Heinlein's The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. Besides those books, I've been trying to read alongside some of my friends, in a book club of two. After those, I've been getting more involved in gothic horror, specifically Shirley Jackson. I read half of Upton Sinclair's Lanny Budd series, a historically accurate and informative historic fiction series about European politics starting right before World War One and ending in the Cold War. My background is in journalism, so I have a fascination with books about the 1st Amendment, civil rights, and the free press.

<br><br>I designed this Python script to empower other readers to post more long-form reviews. There is not a good space for that right now. Twitter is dying. Goodreads is clunky, focuses too much on reading goals, and doesn't foster discussion. Instagram is limited by being a photo-centric site.

<br><br>Your version of this site should be incredibly easy to set up.</p>

<h3 id="If This Isn't Nice, What Is?"><i>If This Isn't Nice, What Is?</i> by Kurt Vonnegut</h3>
                <p>This collection of graduation speeches provided a direct intimate look into Vonnegut's mind, which is often hidden by anecdotes and jokes. He speaks to the importance of large families, the importance of reading and the importance of secular humanism. The speeches are bite-sized. I've been to three graduation ceremonies: one for my brother's, one for a friend, and one for my girlfriend (my own was cancelled by the pandemic). Each of the speakers were boring, trite, and unmemorable. Vonnegut's speeches not only reinvigorated an appreciation for speeches in general, but replaced all my missed opportunities for graduation guidance. I recommend for anyone who's read Slaughterhouse 5 and who are begging to hear more. 9/10.</p>

                <h3 id="It Can't Happen Here"><i>It Can't Happen Here</i> by Sinclair Lewis</h3>
                <p>This book is anti-fascist propaganda from a time when fascism was extremely popular: 1935. This was before WWII, and while multiple Americans were actively speaking in favor of fascist policies. It details a fictional account of a fascist victory in the United States that results in the destruction of our democracy, featuring multiple real-life agitators. It raises questions of complicity, democracy, and civic duty. The protagonist is a newspaper editor in a small Vermont town. He struggles with what he should do in the face of the approaching autocracy. He's not as heoric as he thought. 10/10.</p>

                <h3 id="Dodsworth"><i>Dodsworth</i> by Sinclair Lewis</h3>
                <p>Sam Dodsworth is an industrius businessman who specialized in mid-market cars and who has come across retirement suddenly, with an unfulfilled 30-year promise to take his wife to Europe. Their travels across the continent are full of personal, private, and romantic mistakes. The heart of the novel is an existential question of individuality. Who is a person without a family, a community, a job and a purpose? Fran Dodsworth is cast two-dimensionally, she doesn't achieve much depth, and her character seems in part to be made as a vindiction against Sinclair Lewis' actual divorced wife. That's my only complaint. It's fun for travelers. 9/10.</p>
