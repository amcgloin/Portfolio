    <p class="fr">Youk Chhang is the Director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia. As a native Cambodian, he has not been shut down or jailed like the majority of English speaking reporters or publications.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <h1>Risk Assessment: Cambodia</h1>
    <p>I am using the assessment questions from the Reporters Without Borders’s Safety Guide for Journalists.</p>
    <h3>Do I know enough about the place I am going?</h3>
    <p>No. If I go to Cambodia I probably would report from Phnom Pen, a well-documented city in terms of its layout. Unless my assignment takes me out of the city into rural Cambodia, I will have a reasonable idea of the city maps. </p>
    <p>I would not, however, know enough about the political landscape or how to report in Cambodia. Most English speaking journalists have left the country and the two biggest English-speaking newspapers have either been closed or been sold, so I would have little support system.
    </p>
    <p>Considering that reporters are being barred from news events and arrested for flying drones, I would be unaware of how to get sources to work with me, how to find a fixer, or work with the government. If journalists who have reported in Cambodia for years are unable to report now, I do not know how I would have the knowledge to pick up where they left off.</p>
    <p>It would be best to work with local journalists if I were to go,  or if I want to help document Cambodia from outside.</p>
    <h3>Is the subject sufficiently newsworthy to justify the risks that I am taking?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Coming into the elections, Cambodia is a recovering nation with a genocidal dictator who is dissolving opposing parties and closing independent newspapers. Hun Sen’s policies are a miniaturized version of China’s during Mao Zedong and Russia’s under Joseph Stalin. His actions in Cambodia are a modern day case study of an autocracy without the conflict areas of Syria or Bosnia in the 1990’s. </p>
    <p>Having an accurate recording of Hun Sen’s actions while he is reassuming his hold on power is important. With The Cambodia Daily closed and The Phnom Pen Post sold, there is even greater demand for English reporting.</p>
    <p>I most likely would be unable to cover the election, however. Three journalists, one an independent Australian filmmaker and two from Radio Free Asia, have been imprisoned on charges of spying. Other journalists have fled the country, such as Ben Paviour of The Cambodian Daily or Aun Pheap. </p>
    <p>While the subject is newsworthy enough to justify the risks, I doubt I would actually be able to cover it.</p>
    <h3>What are the potential risks and how well prepared am I to cope with them?</h3>
    <p>I could face jail time, prison time, harassment and death. While reporters haven’t been killed since 2016, Hun Sen’s crackdown on independent media could start a return to more violent means of suppressing journalists.</p>
    <p>I probably would just be jailed though, following in the footsteps of James Ricketson, who has been jailed for a full year with charges of spying but no trial.</p>
    <h3>Have I worked out a procedure to stay in contact with my newsdesk and my family?</h3>
    <p>I would use the secure messaging app signal for staying in contact with both, and a VPN for sending in my work through an email made for the purpose of sending in articles. If my news desk has SecureDrop or can get SecureDrop, I would use that.</p>
    <h3>Do I really want to go and am I physically and psychologically ready?</h3>
    <p>I do not want to go. Although it would be great to go, even experienced Cambodian foreign reporters are leaving the country. If they do not think it is safe for them, it probably is not safe for me. </p>
    <p>Physically I am fine to go, but psychologically I am not ready for the jail time which I would receive.</p>
