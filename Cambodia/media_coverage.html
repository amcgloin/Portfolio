    <p>Cambodia is primarily a televion based news economy, which I do not have any access to. I also do not have access to radio, and if I did would not be able to understand it, which is about 39 percent of the news economy. My comparison will be naturally skewed as a result.</p><p>I have chosen four digital newspapers to compare: Koh Santepheap Daily, which is a khmer-language paper that is automatically translated by google, The Guardian, The Phnom Pen Post, and Radio Free Asia. RFA was just recently kicked out of the country, and there is speculation that the Phnom Pen Post will follow. </p>

    <h1><a class="h1link no-underline dim" href="https://kohsantepheapdaily.com.kh/">Koh Santepheap Daily</a></h1> 
    </div>
<article class="row"><br>
    <p>
    Koh Santepheap Daily appeared to have a regular spread of news stories, with different sections for health, culture, sports, and national news. One of its top stories was on an <a class="h1link no-underline dim" href="https://kohsantepheapdaily.com.kh/article/630087.html">opposition leader being released from jail</a> after being brought up on drug production charges. Another is on a <a class="h1link no-underline dim" href="https://kohsantepheapdaily.com.kh/article/630037.html">new political party</a> that has just been registered, and then there is the regular safety concerns like a <a class="h1link no-underline dim" href="https://kohsantepheapdaily.com.kh/article/630131.html">high amount of accidents</a> on the road recently.</p> <p> There does not seem to be anything highly critical of the government in here, or anything investigative. The majority of the articles are short briefs. One discusses a <a class="h1link no-underline dim" href="https://kohsantepheapdaily.com.kh/article/71721.html">porn star,</a> and another a woman who <a class="h1link no-underline dim" href="https://kohsantepheapdaily.com.kh/article/629457.html">dated 200 men in two years.</a><br></p>
   <br>
     <h1><a class="h1link no-underline dim" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/cambodia">The Guardian</a></h1> 
   
<article ><br><p>The Guardian focuses more on the safety of international travelers in Cambodia, and the actions of Hun Sen, Cambodia's Prime Minister. 10 of the 16 stories from this year are about either an Australian woman <a class="h1link no-underline dim" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/12/expats-say-australian-woman-on-drug-charges-in-cambodia-criticised-hun-sen">imprisoned on drug charges,</a> an Australian man imprisoned on charges of locking up three women, five Britons held on pornographic dancing charges, the Australian filmmaker accused of spying, an Australian killed in an explosion or two Australians killed in a landmine accident. </p>
    <p>The other stories are either about  illegal logging, Hun Sen's relationship with Australia, pollution, or Malaraia drgus. </p>
    </article>
    
        <h1><a class="h1link no-underline dim" href="https://www.phnompenhpost.com/">The Phnom Pen Post</a></h1> 
    <article ><br><p>The Post, similar to Koh Santepheap Daily, has a fair share of news sections, with politics, opnion, sport, lifestyle, business, and international. Its main stories are about the party leader released from jail, new service on the railrays, and Thailand's extradition of an alleged terrorist to Denmark instead of Cambodia.</p>
        <p>It contains voices from the opposition, which the other news organizations ignored. Rainsy has announced a boycoot of the July election, and Hun Sen called the Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights as a gangster group.</p>
        <p>Unlike the other groups, The Post also has video detailing cultural nuances like<a class="h1link no-underline dim" href="https://www.phnompenhpost.com/video/cambodian-potters-spinning-back-wheel-time">sixth-century Cambodian potter</a> or <a class="h1link no-underline dim" href="https://www.phnompenhpost.com/video/stories-need-be-told-documenting-cambodians-austria">Austrian-Cambodian immgirants.</a>This videos are not published on YouTube, and can not be embedded.</p>
    </article>
        
        <h1><a class="h1link no-underline dim" href="https://www.phnompenhpost.com/video/stories-need-be-told-documenting-cambodians-austria">Radio Free Asia</a></h1> 
    <article ><br><p>Radio Free Asia only focuses on Cambodian politics, and does so in an oppositional way. It is funded through the United States, so it makes sense that they only care about the pursuit of Democracy. </p>
        <p>Is top story is about the alleged terrorist that The Post also wrote about, but looks at the charges as spurious and unsubstantial, and the man's extradition to Denmark as an individual evading the grasp of a dictator rather than a violation of Thailand's diplomatic relationship with Cambodia.</p>
        <p>Some of RFA's other stories relate to slain activists, security personnel for the election, and the ballot boycott.</p>
    </article>
 
            <h1>Comparing</h1> 
        <article ><br><p>The Guardian did not seem to care      about the inner workings of Cambodia. It did not mention the upcoming elections, or Hun Sen's attacks on free press and political parties. It also did not mention any of the cultural nuances of Cambodia, or relate to everday life of Cambodian people.</p>
        <p>Koh Santepheap Daily has very little discussion about the elections or the opposition parties. This may be due to what Ben Paviour said about Hun Sen cracking down on Khmer language papers and giving English language papers more press freedom. It would also explain how the Phnom Pen Post and Radio Free Asia was able to write so much about the opposition. Radio Free Asia's recent coverage of the nuances of the culture have probably been harmed since they have been removed from the country, which explains their focus on the elections.</p>
            <p>To get news about Cambodia, it appears the best place to go would be The Phnom Pen Post. It has greater freedom and access than the other news organizations. </p>
